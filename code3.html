Addison contributed many essays, focusing on topics like imagination, friendship, and social reform.</p>
        <p>It was published six days a week and reached a wide audience, shaping English prose and journalism. The Spectator is credited with popularizing the essay form and influencing later writers like Samuel Johnson.</p>
